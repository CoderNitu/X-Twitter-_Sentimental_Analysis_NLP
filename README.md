# X-Twitter-_Sentimental_Analysis_NLP

Build machine learning models that can classify whether the tweets are positive or negative by analyzing the tweets from the Twitter application API dataset with NLP. You can download the dataset that is present in my repo to carry out the project or even go to https://www.kaggle.com to look at different datasets.
